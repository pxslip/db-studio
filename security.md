# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**If you believe you have discovered a security issue within a DB Studio product or service, please open a new private
security vulnerability report through https://github.com/pxslip/db-studio/security/advisories/new. Alternatively, reach
out to us directly over email: [dbstudio@pxslip.com](mailto:dbstudio@pxslip.com).** We will then open a
[GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/pxslip/db-studio/security/advisories) for tracking the fix on your behalf.
